description: Load foundational context for the pi-vs-cc codebase

# Purpose

Orient yourself in pi-vs-cc — a collection of Pi coding agent extensions and agent specs that progressively demonstrate TUI customization, event hooks, widgets, subagent orchestration, and multi-agent teams.

## Workflow

1. Run `git ls-files --others --cached --exclude-standard` to see the project file tree
2. Read `justfile`, `THEME.md`
3. Read `extensions/*`
4. Read `.pi/agents/*`
5. Read `.pi/settings.json`, `extensions/themeMap.ts` (theme defaults + light/dark mode resolution)
6. Summarize your understanding of the project: purpose, stack, structure, key files, and entry points
